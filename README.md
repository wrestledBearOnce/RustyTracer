# RustyTracer (Raytracer in Rust)

## About

Just following along this excellent - now free - e-book  [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

The examples are given in C++. I use Rust instead and try to learn it along the way.

### Beware

Personal project without any time constrait/pressure ;)
Furthermore this is my first real contact with Rust, pardon me for any "strange" code.
