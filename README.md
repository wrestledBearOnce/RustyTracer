# RustyTracer (Raytracer in Rust)

## About

Just following along this excellent - now free - e-book  [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) by Peter Shirley.
The examples are given in C++. I use Rust instead and try to learn it along the way.
### Beware: 
Personal project without any time constrait/pressure ;)
Furthermore this is my first real contact with Rust, pardon me for any "strange" code.
